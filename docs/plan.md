# System de Reservation - Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the System de Reservation based on the requirements specified in the requirements document. The plan addresses current gaps in the system and proposes enhancements to meet all functional and technical requirements while respecting the defined constraints.

## Current System Assessment

Based on analysis of the existing codebase, the System de Reservation currently implements:

However, several requirements are not fully implemented or need improvement:

- Email notification system is missing
- Search and filtering capabilities for rooms are limited
- User profile management is incomplete
- Performance optimization has not been addressed
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
- Security measures need enhancement

## Key Goals and Priorities

From the requirements document, we've identified these key goals:

1. **Complete Core Functionality**: Ensure all basic reservation system features work reliably
2. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve interface, search capabilities, and mobile support
3. **Strengthen Security**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Improve Performance**: Optimize for speed and scalability
